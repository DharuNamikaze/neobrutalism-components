# Installation

## 1. Install shadcn

As explained in introduction, most of these components are based on <a target="_blank" href="https://ui.shadcn.com/">Shadcn UI</a>. 

Visit <a href='https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation' target='_blank'>shadcn installation page</a> to see how to install shadcn.

<br />

## 2. Add styling

Delete the existing styling from your project and add your <Link href='/docs/styling'>desired styling</Link> to your tailwind config.

<br />

## 3. Add components

### Shadcn components

In this docs below each component's name you'll have the shadcn docs link for that component.

<br />

e.g. You want to install shadcn button component. You'll navigate to <a target='_blank' href='/components/button'>button page</a>, click on the shadcn docs
link and install the button component like it's shown in the docs.

<br />

After you're done you'll come back to neobrutalism button page, and copy button component to your project inside `components/ui/button.tsx`
(this is the default component path) or your custom component path.

<br />

Keep in mind that neobrutalism components can have different variants than default shadcn components.

<br />

### Choose the right variant

Remember to copy the right variant of your component, e.g. if you decided to use css variables in your project, copy the css variables variant of that component if it's available.

<br />

### Other components

If the shadcn docs link is not present on the component's page, just copy the component and read the instructions if there are any.
